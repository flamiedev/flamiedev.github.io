        <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p>Software Engineer with almost 4 years of experience, currently an M.Sc. student working with game development and analytics.</p>
        <p>Some of my previous work includes automated tests, api development with Python and Node.js, frontend development with React.js and Angular, game development with Godot and Game Maker Studio 2.</p>
        <p>Currently, my M.Sc. work consists of a tool for analytics focusing on the process of playtesting, so developers can gather relevant information about the coverage during the playtest session, such as level coverage, item coverage, hazard coverage, and others. This way, it can help balance the game and the game design in general.</p>
